# Marsupial Pharmacy
This repository is for Marsupial Pharmacy, the medication dispenser application for the Marsupial EMR environment. <br/>

Marsupial Pharmacy provides similar functionality to popular medication dispensers in hospital environments. It's designed to run on a Windows PC with a touchscreen display, such as an All-In-One computer. It uses the same patient database and medication library used by Marsupial EMR. It supports real time enabling of orders over a network via Marsupial Instructor as well as an Override function. 

[Releases](https://github.com/marsupialproject/marsupial-pharmacy/releases) for Marsupial Pharmacy are available in this repository to download.<br/>
